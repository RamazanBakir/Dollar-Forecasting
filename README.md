###What is The Linear Regression method ?

***The Linear Regression method*** is an analysis method that enables us to examine the statistical relationship between two scalar variables. A relationship based on a hypothesis is extracted by looking at some of the data in the estimated (statistical) relationships.

##In order to make a estimation in linear regression, we need to create a model.
***This model is as follows;***
y=b0+b1.x1 
-• b0 is our constant.
-• The b1 value represents the slope of our model.
-• x1 represents the point to be estimated.
